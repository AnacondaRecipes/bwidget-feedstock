  summary: Simple Widgets for Tcl/Tk.
  description: |
    The BWidget Toolkit is a high-level Widget Set for Tcl/Tk built using
    native Tcl/Tk 8.x namespaces.
    The BWidgets have a professional look&feel as in other well known
    Toolkits (Tix or Incr Widgets), but the concept is radically different
    because everything is pure Tcl/Tk.  No platform dependencies, and no
    compiling required.  The code is 100% Pure Tcl/Tk.
